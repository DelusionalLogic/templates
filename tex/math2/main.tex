Lets say we have a function $\mathcal{M}_{out}(s)
: \mathcal{P}(I^{out}_s)$ which returns the set of output interfaces
matched by $s$, and $\mathcal{M}_{in}(s) : \mathcal{P}(I^{in}_s)$
which does the same for input.

Let $\to_R$ be the original network, we will construct a query network
$\to_{R'}$.

\paragraph{Multi step queries} need to be able to follow all routed in
the original network in layer 0 (meaning it isn't trying to match the
current switch)
\begin{gather*}
	\forall q \in Q \\
	q \to_R q' \\
	\iff \\
	q_{>> s_1 \triangleright_2 \dotsb s_n} \to_{R'}
		q'_{>> s_1 \triangleright_2 \dotsb s_n}
\end{gather*}
\paragraph{Single step queries} just need to be able to move into the
match step, since they aren't allowed to traverse any link before the
match is complete.
\begin{gather*}
	\forall s \in S \wedge \forall in \in I^{in}_s \wedge \forall \ell \in L \\
	in \in \mathcal{M}_{in}(s_1) \\
	\iff \\
	{(s, in)}_{> s_1 \triangleright_2 \dotsb s_n}\ell \to_{R'}
		{(s, in)}_{s_1 \triangleright_2 \dotsb s_n}\ell
\end{gather*}
\paragraph{Interface} If input interface here matches the one we are
currently looking for the model gets the \emph{OPTION} of matching it
now. Which moves it into layer 1 (currently trying to match). This also
removes the path step quantifier from the query.
\begin{gather*}
	\forall s \in S \wedge \forall in \in I^{in}_s \wedge \forall \ell \in L \\
	in \in \mathcal{M}_{in}(s_1) \\
	\iff \\
	{(s, in)}_{>> s_1 \triangleright_2 \dotsb s_n}\ell \to_{R'}
		{(s, in)}_{s_1 \triangleright_2 \dotsb s_n}\ell
\end{gather*}
\paragraph{Layer 1} in layer 1 the model is allowed to follow the normal
routing steps, including failovers and such.
\begin{gather*}
	\forall s \in S \wedge \forall in \in I^{in}_s \wedge \forall out \in I^{out}_s \wedge \forall \ell \in L \\
	(s, in)\ell \to_R (s, out, 0)\ell'
	\\
	\iff
	\\
	{(s, in)}_{s_1 \triangleright_2 \dotsb s_n}\ell \to_{R'}
		{(s, out, 0)}_{s_1 \triangleright_2 \dotsb s_n}\ell'
\end{gather*}
\begin{gather*}
	\forall s \in S \wedge \forall out \in I^{out}_s \wedge \forall 1<i<k \wedge \forall \ell \in L \\
	(s, out, i)\ell \to_R (s, out', i+1)\ell'
	\\
	\iff
	\\
	{(s, out, i)}_{s_1 \triangleright_2 \dotsb s_n}\ell \to_{R'}
		{(s, out', i+1)}_{s_1 \triangleright_2 \dotsb s_n}\ell'
\end{gather*}
\paragraph{Matched} If the output interface is the one we are looking
for the model has an \emph{OPTION} to move into layer 2 (match
completed). Doing so also removes the switch from the query. At this
layer the model is no longer allowed to failover, since it has already
committed to matching.
\begin{gather*}
	out \in \mathcal{M}_{out}(s_1) \wedge (s, out, i)\ell \to_R (s', in)\ell' \\
	\iff \\
	{(s, out, i)}_{s_1 \triangleright_2 \dotsb s_n}\ell \to_{R'}
		{(s', in)}_{\triangleright_2 \dotsb s_n}\ell
	% Do we need this? We might be able to just jump directly to the
	% link (next rule), that way we can eliminate the second variable
\end{gather*}
The input step enters at interstage 1, where the path specifier has
already been removed.
\begin{gather*}
	build \to_{R'}
		q_{s_1 \triangleright_2 \dotsb s_n}
\end{gather*}
